Hey there!
This is Harshith and this is my LLM project and I am looking forward to see how this goes and learning more on this topic.
I have no idea how this works and looking to figure it out after learning this and then thus I could work around this and thus make changes
or personalize this further to match my vibe.


When I first decided to move from India to the US, it didn’t really feel real. Everyone around me seemed more excited than I was — friends saying “Bro, you’re going to America!” and relatives asking the same ten questions about where, when, and why. I’d smile, nod, and pretend I was all pumped about it, but honestly, half the time I was just numb. I didn’t know what to expect. I had this vague image of snow, skyscrapers, and people walking fast with coffee cups, but that was about it. Deep down, I was scared — not of failing, but of not belonging. Of being somewhere that looked like a dream but didn’t quite feel like home.
The weeks leading up to my flight were a blur — shopping for adapters, packing Maggi and masalas like I was building an emergency survival kit, printing documents ten times because everyone kept warning me about immigration officers. I remember standing in my room surrounded by open suitcases, trying to decide which part of my life to fit into 46 kilograms. Every T-shirt had a memory, every item had a story, and it was weird realizing how much we attach emotion to things that won’t even matter later. Still, I stuffed them in anyway — not because I needed them, but because I wasn’t ready to let go.
The airport moment — that’s when it really hit me. Saying bye to my parents, trying to act normal while my chest was on fire. My mom said, “Call us as soon as you land,” and I nodded like it was no big deal, but my throat had that heavy lump. My dad gave me one of those half-hugs, the kind that say a lot without saying anything. Walking through security felt like walking through a door that wouldn’t open both ways. I kept looking back until they weren’t visible anymore, and then it was just me, my backpack, and a silence that didn’t feel right.
On the flight, I couldn’t sleep. I kept thinking about everything — home, food, friends, what I was leaving behind. I replayed random things, like chai breaks with my cousins, that one late-night walk after exams, the sound of auto horns, the smell of rain. It’s strange how your brain holds on to the smallest details once you know they’re about to disappear for a while. Somewhere mid-air, it finally sank in — I was officially on my own. Exciting and terrifying at the same time.
Landing in the US was like stepping into a movie scene you’d seen a hundred times but never really felt. The cold air hit me first — sharper, cleaner, almost judgmental. The roads were wide, people were organized, and every car looked like it belonged in a brochure. I remember smiling awkwardly at strangers who didn’t smile back, then realizing that’s just how it is here — everyone’s polite, but no one’s really available. You feel invisible and visible at the same time.
The first week was chaos. Jet lag, orientation sessions, figuring out public transport, pretending to understand accents that my brain couldn’t keep up with. Every small task felt huge — setting up a bank account, buying a SIM card, cooking for the first time without accidentally burning something. Groceries were a nightmare. I’d stand in the aisle staring at 15 types of bread, wondering which one wasn’t sweet. And milk — why does milk here have so many versions? 1%, 2%, whole, skimmed, lactose-free. Back home, milk was just milk. Here, even that came with choices.
The homesickness hit quietly. It wasn’t just missing people; it was missing familiarity. The noise, the smells, the rhythm of how things happened back home. The random chai stalls, the casual banter, the feeling that everyone somehow knew you or at least your type. Here, everything is efficient but detached. You can go days without really talking to anyone beyond “Hey, how are you?” which no one actually wants an answer to. There’s this loneliness that’s hard to describe — not dramatic, just constant, like a faint background hum you learn to live with.
Then comes the adjustment phase. The part where you stop fighting it and start figuring it out. You learn that rice can be cooked in a pressure cooker or a rice cooker (and both will still somehow taste different). You learn how to stretch your groceries for two weeks and make something edible out of whatever’s left. You learn that friendships take longer to build here — everyone’s nice, but everyone’s busy. You learn to balance coursework, part-time jobs, and endless deadlines while pretending to have your life together. You learn that “I’m fine” becomes your default answer, even when you’re not.
Slowly, you start noticing small victories — the first time you cook something that actually tastes good, the first time you get an A on an assignment you thought you’d fail, the first paycheck from your campus job that you stare at for too long before realizing it’s already gone to rent. You begin to build your rhythm. You start liking the quiet walks, the independence, the feeling of figuring things out your way. You start taking pride in the things that once scared you. The homesickness doesn’t vanish, but it turns into something softer — like nostalgia you’ve learned to live with.
There’s also a funny kind of identity shift that happens. You start mixing accents without realizing it. You switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit like it’s normal. You think in rupees but pay in dollars. You begin explaining things about India to people who only know Bollywood and curry, and sometimes you get defensive because you want them to understand that it’s more than that — it’s chaos, warmth, and unexplainable depth all at once. And when you meet another Indian student, even if they’re from a state you’ve never been to, there’s an instant connection. You get it. You both know what it feels like to be far away but trying to make it feel close.
Then comes the middle phase — when things stop being new, and the real tests begin. The semesters start blending together, the deadlines get heavier, and the excitement wears off a bit. You miss festivals the most during this phase. Back home, Diwali meant lights, sweets, and chaos. Here, it’s just another day unless you create that vibe yourself. You start building your own version of “home” with friends who become family — potlucks with too much spice, playlists that remind you of random roads back home, and laughter that makes the distance feel smaller. That’s when you realize that “home” isn’t really a place anymore; it’s a feeling you rebuild wherever you go.
There are days when it all hits you hard. When you’re tired, broke, and staring at your screen wondering why you ever thought this was a good idea. Those are the nights when you cook Maggi at 2 AM, video call your parents, and pretend you’re fine while your mom tells you to eat fruits. But there are also days when it feels worth it — when you present your project, get appreciation from your professor, or when you walk outside after class, headphones on, and feel like maybe you’re starting to belong. Not completely, but enough to keep going.
Time changes everything. The version of you that landed here is not the same one that survives the first winter, or the one that learns to file taxes, or the one that stays up till 3 AM debugging a project. You start thinking differently. You become more patient, more adaptable, and a little more resilient than you give yourself credit for. You learn to celebrate small wins because those are what keep you afloat — finishing an assignment early, finding a good deal on groceries, cooking biryani that actually tastes close to home.
The longer you stay, the more you realize that surviving here isn’t about doing everything perfectly; it’s about learning to improvise. You learn how to handle visa stress, how to navigate job hunting with a ticking OPT clock, how to manage rent, bills, and still find time to breathe. You start becoming that person people reach out to for advice, and it hits you — you’re no longer the new one figuring things out. You’ve grown quietly, without even noticing when it happened.
Looking back, the journey feels less like one big leap and more like a series of tiny steps — each one confusing, frustrating, and meaningful in its own way. You start appreciating things you took for granted: the comfort of hearing your language in public, the warmth of homemade food, the sound of someone calling your name with the same tone as back home. You realize that surviving here isn’t just about adapting to a new country; it’s about rediscovering yourself in a different context.
There’s also this bittersweet thing that happens when you visit India again after a year or two. Everything feels familiar but also foreign. The same roads, the same faces, but you’re not the same person anymore. You notice details you never did before — how people don’t follow lanes, how everyone talks over each other, how chaotic and beautiful it all is. You laugh at the small inconveniences because now they feel like home. You realize that you’ve built two versions of yourself — one that belongs here, and one that belongs there — and they both coexist, even if they don’t overlap perfectly.
I think the hardest and best part about moving from India to the US is that it forces you to grow in ways you didn’t plan for. You become resourceful, emotionally tougher, but also more grateful. You stop needing everything to make sense. You learn to live with uncertainty, to trust yourself more, to build your own version of “home” wherever you go. It’s not easy — it’s messy, lonely, and sometimes frustrating beyond words — but it’s also real. Every mistake, every small victory, every long night staring at your laptop trying to figure life out, it all adds up.
I don’t think anyone truly “masters” this transition. You just learn how to float in it, how to find comfort in motion. The survival part slowly turns into living, and living slowly turns into belonging. And somewhere along the way, you realize that all the chaos, all the learning, all the quiet nights away from home — they’ve built someone stronger, calmer, and more aware. Someone who may not have it all figured out, but knows that’s okay. Because figuring it out — that’s kind of the whole point.
